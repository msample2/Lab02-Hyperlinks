</head>

<body>
    The Audi C7 (2012–2015) and C7.5 (2016–2018) generations of the A6, A7, and their performance variants were known for their sophisticated interiors, advanced technology, and powerful engines. 
    The C7.5 represents a mid-cycle refresh that included cosmetic upgrades like updated bumpers and lighting elements, a faster MMI infotainment system, and the addition of modern features like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. 
    Both are admired by many for their timeless styling, smooth ride, and high build quality.
